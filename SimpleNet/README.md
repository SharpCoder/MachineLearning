MachineLearning
===============

SimpleNet was a challenge for myself to create the fastest NeuralNetwork graph as possible. I think I nailed it! This code can evaluate a very small graph (1->2->1) in 1 cpu tick (according to Stopwatch). It scales really really well too. Unfortunately, this sample only has the graph evaluation code (not the learning code). I will be adding that in at a later date.
